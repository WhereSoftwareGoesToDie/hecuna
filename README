hecuna
======

hecuna is a Cassandra loadtesting/benchmarking tool. At the moment it's
pre-alpha-quality, but still usable if you don't mind a little pain.
Written by sio; let me know if you encounter any problems.

building
========

You'll need a working go 1.1 installation, plus gossie
(https://github.com/carloscm/gossie/) and thrift4go
(https://github.com/pomack/thrift4go). Once everything is in place (and
your GOPATH is set up correctly), all you need is `go build`. That'll
give you a statically-linked binary runnable on any machine with the
same architecture (binary format and word size). 

usage
=====

`hecuna -hosts="host0:9160,host1:9610" -poolsize=10 -rowcount=10000`
